## Why I began this project
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## How I implemented this project
This project was implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html), with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the front-end.

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
This project has strengthened my familiarity with creating HTML and API routes from scratch, and I hope to use this knowledge to build even more complex applications.
